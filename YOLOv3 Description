You only look once (YOLO) is an object detection system targeted for real-time processing
YOLO divides the input image into an S×S grid. Each grid cell predicts only one object.
Each grid cell predicts a fixed number of boundary boxes
For each grid cell,
it predicts B boundary boxes and each box has one box confidence score,
it detects one object only regardless of the number of boxes B,
it predicts C conditional class probabilities (one per class for the likeliness of the object class).
![YOLO makes SxS predictions with B boundary boxes.](https://miro.medium.com/max/4226/1*OuMJUWo2rXYA-GYU63NUGw.jpeg)

Each boundary box contains 5 elements: (x, y, w, h) and a box confidence score. 
 The confidence score reflects how likely the box contains an object (objectness) and how accurate is the boundary box. 
 We normalize the bounding box width w and height h by the image width and height. x and y are offsets to the corresponding cell. 
 Hence, x, y, w and h are all between 0 and 1.
 Each cell has 20 conditional class probabilities. 
 The conditional class probability is the probability that the detected object belongs to a particular class (one probability per category for each cell). 
 So, YOLO’s prediction has a shape of (S, S, B×5 + C) = (7, 7, 2×5 + 20) = (7, 7, 30)
 
The class confidence score for each prediction box is computed as:
It measures the confidence on both the classification and the localization (where an object is located).
