# INF368-EXS2
## Task 1
- Choose a deep neural network architecture that is known to achieve good performance
for image recognition. 
  - Sugguestion: YOLOv2 or v3 
- You will provide in-depth information about this architecture. 
- Implement it using the tensorflow.keras API.
  - cfg to h5 for any choosen yolo model.
- Verify in practice the ability of your model to recognize images on the SVHN dataset (SVHN is similar in flavor to MNIST, but for image recognition tasks - see http://ufldl.stanford.edu/house

Task 1
1. Describe architecture
1. implement model with weights
2. test model with data

Task 2
1. Datascience
2. Data generator
3. Create model
  - Cut of head and twick
  - Model selection on the head
4. Train on the given dataset
