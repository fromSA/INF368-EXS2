# INF368-EXS2
## Task 1
- Choose a deep neural network architecture that is known to achieve good performance
for image recognition. 
  - Sugguestion: YOLOv2 or v3 
- You will provide in-depth information about this architecture. 
- Implement it using the tensorflow.keras API.
  - cfg to h5 for any choosen yolo model.
- Verify in practice the ability of your model to recognize images on the SVHN dataset (SVHN is similar in flavor to MNIST, but for image recognition tasks - see http://ufldl.stanford.edu/house
