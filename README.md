## Task 1
- Choose a deep neural network architecture that is known to achieve good performance
for image recognition. 
- You will provide in-depth information about this architecture. 
- Implement it using the tensorflow.keras API. Verify in practice the ability of your model to
recognize images on the SVHN dataset (SVHN is similar in flavor to MNIST, but for image recognition tasks - see http://ufldl.stanford.edu/house
